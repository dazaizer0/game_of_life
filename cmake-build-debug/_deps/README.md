# missing folder: raylib-src
The raylib source code should be located here,
unfortunately due to the large size of the folder which would make it impossible to upload the project to github it is not here.

To run this CMake project correctly, you need to download the raylib source code from the creator's github page and insert it here.

However, the "mol-game of life" program can be downloaded in .exe format on the releases page.

**raylib-src download:** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

what it should look like: _deps/raylib-src ->
![in raylib-src](https://github.com/dazaizer0/sol-game_of_life/assets/60112867/afae535b-c6ab-4922-85a5-137634d45ac2)
